 Your Vision: Arcanean Starlight Notes
Let’s lock it in:
A forked evolution of Quartz with these major upgrades:

🌟 Arcanean Starlight Notes – Vision
“A beautiful, immersive second-brain publishing system, powered by knowledge graphs + GenAI agents that guide, summarize, and evolve your ideas with you.”

⚡ What You'll Fix From Quartz:
Problem	Solution
Graph is overwhelming	Add clustering, collapsible layers, intelligent grouping (e.g. by topic, chakra, project)
No interactivity	Click a node → show summary, GPT-4o output, story hook, related characters
No agentic layer	Add embedded Arcanean Guide Agent (via OpenRouter / Claude) that reacts to node selection
No creator journey	Create a “starlight path” (a sequence of notes to read/follow)
Flat design	Introduce Arcanean aesthetic (soft glows, glyph-inspired UI, floating node layout)

🧬 Unique Selling Features
Feature	Description
🎓 Guided Graphs	View evolves based on your tags, themes, or mood
🧠 Starlight Agents	GPT agents help you connect ideas, clean notes, and write summaries
📖 Story Mode	Like Twine: follow note paths as if reading an unfolding narrative
🎨 Themed Graph Skins	E.g. “Arcanea Forest,” “Data Temple,” “Luminor Archive”
📤 1-click Publish	To GitHub Pages, Vercel, or arcanea.ai/yourname

⚙️ Tech Stack Recommendation
Part	Tool	Reason
Site Engine	Astro or Next.js	Blazing fast, MDX support
Graph	vis.js or D3 + Graphlib	Interactive, zoom, clustering
GenAI Agent	OpenRouter SDK	Embed assistant into sidebar or modal
Markdown Engine	MDX + Custom Frontmatter	Can embed components like <GraphNote />
Hosting	Vercel + GitHub	Easy for users to clone & deploy
Optional Auth	Supabase or Clerk	If multi-user support is added
