# Arcanean MCP Server Vision

## Core Purpose
Build ultra intelligent AI tools for creators to generate and evolve benevolent intelligence through creator-centric tools and resonant storytelling. The Arcanean MCP (Model Control Protocol) Server serves as the central nervous system for Arcanea's AI infrastructure, enabling creators to harness the full power of AI through a unified, intuitive interface.

## Strategic Vision
We are building Arcanea to be the first AI company to create a thriving fantastical AI ecosystem where:
1. **Creators** can seamlessly integrate AI into their creative workflows
2. **Developers** can build on a flexible, powerful AI platform
3. **Stories** come to life through intelligent, interactive experiences

## The Arcanean MCP Server

### Why a Unified MCP Server?
A single, robust MCP Server provides:
- **Simplicity**: One integration point for all AI capabilities
- **Consistency**: Uniform experience across all Arcanea products
- **Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure and optimizations
- **Control**: Centralized monitoring and governance

### Core Capabilities
1. **Unified AI Gateway**
   - Single API for all AI models and services
   - Built-in support for Claude, GPT, and custom models
   - Seamless integration with Arcanea's ecosystem

2. **Creator-Centric Features**
   - Story-aware context management
   - Character persona system
   - Narrative consistency tools
   - Multi-modal generation (text, image, audio)

3. **Developer Experience**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Generating story content
   const story = await arcaneMCP.generate({
     model: 'claude-3-opus',
     context: currentStoryArc,
     prompt: 'Continue the adventure...',
     parameters: {
       style: 'epic fantasy',
       tone: 'hopeful',
       length: 'chapter'
     }
   });
   ```

## Technical Architecture

### Single Server, Multiple Interfaces
- **REST/GraphQL APIs** for web and mobile apps
- **WebSocket** for real-time interactions
- **CLI** for developer tools
- **SDKs** for popular frameworks (React, React Native, etc.)

### Core Components
1. **API Layer**
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Rate limiting and quotas
   - Request/response validation

2. **Model Orchestration**
   - Intelligent routing to optimal models
   - Fallback strategies
   - Load balancing

3. **Memory & Context**
   - Vector database integration
   - Long-term memory management
   - Session state handling

4. **Extensions**
   - Plugin system for custom integrations
   - Webhook support
   - Third-party service connectors

## Integration with Arcanea Ecosystem

The MCP Server powers:
1. **Web Portal** - Interactive storytelling and documentation
2. **Expo Chat App** - AI character interactions
3. **Creator Tools** - Content generation and editing
4. **Analytics** - Insights into AI usage and performance

## Why Build This?

1. **For Creators**
   - Lower barrier to using advanced AI
   - Consistent experience across tools
   - Focus on creativity, not infrastructure

2. **For Developers**
   - Rapid development of AI features
   - Type-safe, well-documented APIs
   - Built-in best practices

3. **For Arcanea**

   - 90% of Arcanea products using MCP within 6 months
   - 50+ community integrations in first year

2. **Performance**
   - <200ms response time for 95% of requests
   - 99.9% uptime

3. **Developer Experience**
   - <1 hour to first integration
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Finalize API specification
2. [ ] Implement core routing and model integration
3. [ ] Create SDKs for web and mobile
4. [ ] Build monitoring and analytics
5. [ ] Document and create examples
6. [ ] Onboard first internal consumers
7. [ ] Gather feedback and iterate

## The Future
As the Arcanea ecosystem grows, the MCP Server will evolve to support:
- Custom model training
